In this commit 
global error handler is implemented
in this , each error weather cause due to some operation (Operational error)
or cause by programme (programme error)
is handled by a error middleware which calls function globalErrorHandler

for Operational error we use AppError class which has property isOperational set to true

in case of error , two things can happen 
1) either error in development environement
in this case all information is shown in response regarding with error
2) either error in production environement 
in this case limited information is shown in response  

in case of production environement if error is programme error then in order to give meaningful
response message condition is used based on isOperational
